            "description": "Biological networks are powerful resources for the discovery of molecular phenotypes. Here, we show that proteins are more likely to have similar phenotypes, not if they directly interact in a molecular network, but if they interact with the same proteins. We call this the mutual interactor principle and show that it holds for several kinds of molecular networks, including protein-protein interaction, genetic interaction, and signaling networks. We then develop a machine learning framework for predicting molecular phenotypes on the basis of mutual interactors. Strikingly, the framework can predict drug targets, disease proteins, and protein functions in different species, and it performs better than much more complex algorithms. The framework is robust to incomplete biological data and capable of generalizing to phenotypes it has not seen during training.",

            "description": "Computational decision support systems could provide clinical value in full-body PET-CT workflows. However, the lack of labeled data and the sheer size of PET-CT studies make it challenging to apply existing supervised machine learning systems to these full-body scans. Leveraging recent advancements in natural language processing, we introduce a weak-supervision framework that extracts imperfect, yet highly granular regional abnormality training labels from the radiologist reports associated with each scan. Using these labels, we train a multi-task 3D convolutional neural network to detect abnormalities in 26 anatomical regions commonly of interest in PET-CT protocols. Our model can detect lymph node, lung and liver abnormalities with median areas under the curve of 87%, 85% and 92%, respectively. We show that performing multi-task pre-training on these core tasks can enable strong performance on rare abnormalities and orthogonal tasks. Multi-task pre-training enables improvements of 28 and 17 AUC percentage-points in detecting abnormalities in the kidney and pancreas, respectively."
